XNXX Downloader is a browser extension built for users who want a cleaner way to save supported XNXX videos for offline viewing. It detects the current media source used by the page, surfaces available quality options when present, and exports the final file as MP4 without forcing you to inspect player code or use external tools.

- Save supported XNXX videos from watch pages
- Detect player-backed media sources and available quality variants
- Export MP4 files for easier playback and archiving
- Avoid manual source extraction from page scripts
- Keep the workflow fully in the browser

## Why XNXX Downloader

XNXX pages can expose multiple media variants and player states depending on how playback is initialized. Generic download tools often pick the wrong asset, miss the real stream, or return incomplete results once the player switches between sources.

XNXX Downloader is built to reduce that friction. Start the video, let the extension detect the supported stream, choose the quality you want, and export the result as MP4 without leaving the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported XNXX video sources from active pages
- Multi-source video detection including script functions, HLS manifests, and page metadata
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Lists available quality variants when present
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Exports MP4 files for simpler offline playback
- Automatic saving into a dedicated XNXX folder
- Desktop notifications when downloads complete
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open XNXX and visit a video page.
3. Start playback so the extension can detect the stream.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button.
5. Choose the quality or stream option you want.
6. Download the video as MP4.
7. Save the final file locally.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Videos from XNXX

1. Install XNXX Downloader from the latest GitHub release.
2. Open XNXX and sign in if the page you want requires account access.
3. Visit the video page you want to keep.
4. Let the player load fully and press play.
5. Click the in-page download button on the player, or open the extension popup.
6. Review the quality options shown by the extension.
7. Choose the quality you want if multiple options are available.
8. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
9. Open the saved file from your Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported XNXX video sources (low quality, high quality, HLS multi-resolution)
- Output: MP4

Saved files use MP4 so they are easier to replay on standard media players, move between devices, or archive locally.

## Who It's For

- XNXX viewers who want offline copies of supported videos
- Users who prefer a browser extension over manual extraction
- People archiving videos they already have access to in the browser
- Users who want a clean MP4 workflow for later playback
- Anyone who wants cleaner download controls than generic downloader sites

## Common Use Cases

- Save an XNXX video for later viewing
- Export the available quality as MP4
- Avoid manually tracing player source URLs
- Keep local copies for offline playback
- Use the in-page button or right-click menu for a faster download flow

## Troubleshooting

**The extension is not detecting the video**
Start playback first and wait for the player to initialize the active source.

**Only one quality is shown**
Some pages expose only one usable stream, so only one option may appear.

**The wrong source appears**
Refresh the page and retry after playback starts again.

**The download stopped partway through**
Check whether your internet connection dropped during the download.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.
